For three decades, America has lost semiconductor manufacturing to countries like China – but we’re changing that. We’re investing in American workers and building the future here in America.
Today, along with Intel, I’m excited to announce that construction on a new semiconductor factory in Columbus, Ohio will begin this year. The factory will bring thousands of jobs to Ohio and help ensure the future is made in America.
A year ago, we inherited an economy in crisis. Countless hardworking Americans and small businesses were hurting through no fault of their own. That’s why we focused on getting the American Rescue Plan passed to deliver much-needed relief to folks like Samir.
For years, Washington has talked about passing an infrastructure bill but failed to deliver. In our first year, we got it done. We are rebuilding our nation’s crumbling infrastructure and creating millions of good-paying union jobs in the process.
When I took office a year ago, our nation was in crisis. 18 million Americans were receiving unemployment benefits and less than 1% of adults were vaccinated.

Today, the unemployment rate has dropped to 3.9% and nearly 75% of adults have been fully vaccinated.

That’s progress.
One year in, and America is moving forward.
210 million Americans fully vaccinated.
96% of schools open.
6.4 million jobs created.
3.9% unemployment.
5 million Americans gained health insurance.

We had a historic first year — and we’re going to keep building on our progress in the years ahead.
