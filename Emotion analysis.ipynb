Other option is you walk through a different bedroom to get to its en-suite. Signs all over the apartment - there are signs everywhere - some helpful - some telling you rules. Perhaps some people like this but It negatively affected our enjoyment of the accommodation.Stairs - lots of them - some had slightly bending wood which caused a minor injury.\""
